# AlgorithmsForEveryone

A comprehensive collection of common algorithms and data structures, with implementations in Java and Python. This
project is designed for educational purposes, providing clear and well-documented code.

## Implementations

This repository contains two separate library implementations:

- **‚òï Java**: A robust, type-safe implementation using modern Java (version 21+).
- **üêç Python**: A clean, idiomatic Python implementation (version 3.6+).

Please see the language-specific READMEs for detailed installation and usage instructions.

## Available Algorithms & Data Structures

The following are available in both the Java and Python libraries:

### Sorting Algorithms

## Acknowledgments

This project was developed based on my university coursework in data structures and algorithms. The course curriculum
itself draws heavily from the classic textbook **"Algorithms, 4th Edition"** by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne.

Consequently, since this library is a direct reflection of my studies, its API design and implementation strategies will
show a strong resemblance to those presented in the book.
